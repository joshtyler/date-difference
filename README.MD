#date-difference

A simple program written in C to calculate the difference between two dates read from standard input.

This program was created as part of an introduction to C class. The two versions of the program behave differently, with TYLERJ-date2.c being the more advanced.

## Notes

These programs use a modified version of the algorithm to determine when leap years occur (as prescribed by the assignment specification), so will not calculate all dates correctly.

The program uses tabs/spaces in a strange way, so will look odd with a tab width different to two.
